Items to add
============


Things to do first
------------------

Handle @Focus3

Should we refocus after meridian flip

Should we refocus every n exposures?

Things to do later
------------------

Check for lost guiding. If lost for <x> secs stop imaging and wait until re-acqire. once re-acquired re-centre.

Auto Stop if Sun is higher than <x>.

Analyse images to determine if guiding, location is OK.

Analyse images to check for saturation.

Allow the grouping of sequence (i.e. focus group, CLS....)

Need to add code for event that user disconnects camera/fw/foc from SkyX.

Add FTP option.

We should disable changes to the imaging sequence once started.

We should have a timeout in the imaging loop (timer tick) if PHD does not start guiding.

Look at exceptions when changing filters and focusing.

Telescope slew limits.  Define areas of sky not to image in.
